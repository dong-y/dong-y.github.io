<hr />

<p>Last afternoon, I attended the head of IS, prof Teo&rsquo;s seminar on &ldquo;your future&rdquo;. Nothing about techincal or theoratical stuff while some interesting stories were shared about his own experience. If there&rsquo;s a clue for the talk, I think it might be making contribution to <strong>knowledge</strong>, to <strong>students</strong>, to <strong>university&rsquo;s or international communities</strong>.</p>

<p>As a PhD student, or a researcher in the future, we are expected to find the gap between reality and prior research and make contribution to the relevant domain. This is the foundemental criteria for PhD students. It is almost the survival manual for each of us.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Most of us will become faculty members in a few years. It is far fromenough to just generate knowledge while it is almost equally important to disseminate knowledge to students, practitioners or even the mass. It must be cool to share your research results with people from different fields like Dan Ariely and Chris Anderson.</p>

<p>If in the next 10 years I could achieve the above two kinds of contribution, I think I might be a fair research faculty in whatever university. However, the more I know about &ldquo;research field&rdquo;, I find it more than just &ldquo;research&rdquo;. Prof. Teo shared that the first year he got employed by NUS he started to write emails to editors in A-Journals, briefly introducing himself, his research interest and his willingness to review relevant papers voluntarily. After one or two years&#8217; persistence, he finally got a chance to review papers and till now he has served for the editorial board for quite a number of top journals. By reviewing papers voluntarily, Prof. Teo has got himself well-known by others and also he keeps the latest trend of research topics.</p>

<p>Additionally the importance of making yourself famous, say marketing yourself, can never be stressed more even in research field. Reviewers or editors are first of all humanbeings and then experts. It is always the case that they will 100% reject a paper with an unkown author. Hence attending conference, media metion and invited talks are important ways to make yourself known by others. I think I might start my own homepage at the end of this year to share knowledge about data analysis like &ldquo;statwiki&rdquo;, of course with a CV link.</p>

<p>One more interesting inspiration. When Prof. Teo did case study in 1990s, the questionnairs were sent out by mail. The secretaries of CEO, CIO and CFO in large companies are overwhelmed with mails every day. How can Teo make him questionnairs distinguished? The answer is simple: just by printing them in different colors of papers, red for CEO, green for CIO and yellow for CFO. When he made phone calls to secretaries, he just asked if they could fill in the &ldquo;red, green and yellow&rdquo; questionnairs and the answers were mostly positive because of the little trick. Research is more than just research. As is usual the case, it demands the ability to solve miscellaneous problems with your own intelligence.</p>

<p>Well finally, here&rsquo;s a question: How can you make yourself impressive to &ldquo;big name&#8221;s in a conference?</p>

<p><em>Raise questions.</em></p>

<p>This is also one of the reasons why I started to write my own blog and share what I&rsquo;ve learned with others.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a tutorial on how to create a free blog with Octopress and Github for <strong>greenhands</strong>, well just like me! I am a PhD student in Information Systems and would like to share what I learned with others through a blog. But I know little about html and web development&hellip; <strong>markdown</strong> really saved my life. If you are interested in <strong>coding</strong> a blog like me, this tutorial might be helpful.</p>

<p>PS: This is a tutorial on <strong>mac OSX Yosemite</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Install Ruby</li>
<li>Install and Configure Octopress</li>
<li>Deploy your Blog</li>
<li>Start to Write!</li>
<li>Errors You Might Run Into</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.Get your Github account</h2>

<p>At the beginning, make sure that you have a <strong>Github</strong> account and add a <code>repository</code> in the format like <strong>username</strong>.github.io. No other names allowed! If you&rsquo;d like a cool name like <code>blackpumpkin</code>, please purchase one on <code>godaddy</code>.</p>

<h2>1.Install Ruby</h2>

<p>Firstly, open your <strong>Terminal</strong> and then type the code below.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl -L http://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</span><span class='line'>$ rvm install 2.0
</span><span class='line'>$ rvm use 2.0
</span><span class='line'>$ rvm rubygems latest</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>2.Install and Configure Octopress</h2>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git coder_blog</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are two ways to install theme. If you would like to find some cool and stylish theme, then you should definitely use <strong>third-party</strong> theme.</p>

<h3>Install default theme</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ cd octopress
</span><span class='line'>$ gem install bundler
</span><span class='line'>$ bundle install
</span><span class='line'>$ rake install </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install third-party theme</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ cd octopress
</span><span class='line'>$ git clone git://github.com/panks/fabric.git .themes/fabric
</span><span class='line'>$ rake install['fabric']
</span><span class='line'>$ rake generate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can pick up a theme you like <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">here</a>. But remember to adapt the code above.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Now you have to open the &lsquo;_config.yml&rsquo; and change the <code>url</code> <code>title</code> <code>sbutitle</code> <code>author</code>. If you are interested in, you can also enable some third party services there.</p>

<h2>Deploy your Blog</h2>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ rake setup_github_pages[git@github.com:yourname/yourname.github.io.git]
</span><span class='line'>$ rake generate
</span><span class='line'>$ rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you need to play a round of Doodle Jump and drink a cup of coffee. Then you can visit your own homepage.</p>

<h2>Start to Write!</h2>

<p>The default format of blog is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>. It is quite easy to learn how to use it. Try it and you&rsquo;ll love it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ rake new_post["title"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can find a file like <code>source/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown</code>. Open it with <a href="http://25.io/mou/">Mou</a> or some markdown editor you like. Start writing!
When you finish it, you need simply follow the steps:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ rake generate
</span><span class='line'>$ rake watch
</span><span class='line'>$ rake preview # preview your blog at http://localhost:4000
</span><span class='line'>$ rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can insert <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code> in your blog to prevent the post content below this mark from being displayed on the index page for the blog posts, a &ldquo;Continue →&rdquo; button links to the full post.</p>

<h2>PS (but very important)</h2>

<p>Sorry, I put it in the last merely because where I ran into these errors which has driven me crazy.
You might run into the following error and find the following helpful:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Building Warining: Layout 'nil' requested in blog/tags/git/atom.xml do</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here is the solution: find the files</p>

<ul>
<li><code>source/atom.xml</code></li>
<li><code>source/robots.txt</code></li>
<li><code>source/_includes/custom/category_feed.xml</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Replace <code>layout: null</code> with <code>layout:nil</code></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me why&hellip; If you are curious, please ask google.</p>

<p>Woohoo! I&rsquo;m satisfied with my own blog right now. What about you?</p>
